                <h2>Itachi Uchiha</h2>
                <p>Itachi was a prodigy of the Uchiha clan,<br> known for his calm intelligence and unmatched<br> skill from a young age. Though seen as a traitor<br> for massacring his entire clan, his true motive<br> was to protect his younger brother, Sasuke, and<br> prevent a civil war that could destroy the Hidden<br> Leaf Village. Burdened with guilt and loneliness,<br> Itachi carried his secret until his death, when the truth of<br> his sacrifice was finally revealed. He is remembered as a<br> tragic hero — a man who gave everything for peace.</p>

But after learning the truth about Itachi’s<br> sacrifice, Sasuke’s anger turned toward the system<br> that caused his brother’s suffering.
