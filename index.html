                <h2 class="itachi">Itachi Uchiha</h2>
                <p>Itachi was a prodigy of the Uchiha clan,<br> known for his calm intelligence and unmatched<br> skill from a young age. Though seen as a traitor<br> for massacring his entire clan, his true motive<br> was to protect his younger brother, Sasuke, and<br> prevent a civil war that could destroy the Hidden<br> Leaf Village. Burdened with guilt and loneliness,<br> Itachi carried his secret until his death, when the truth of<br> his sacrifice was finally revealed. He is remembered as a<br> tragic hero — a man who gave everything for peace.</p>

                <h2>Sasuke Uchiha</h2>
                <p>Sasuke grew up haunted by the loss of his family<br> and driven by hatred toward his brother, Itachi.<br> His quest for vengeance consumed him, leading<br> him down a dark path that isolated him from friends<br> and allies. But after learning the truth about Itachi’s<br> sacrifice, Sasuke’s anger turned toward the system<br> that caused his brother’s suffering. Torn between<br> revenge and redemption, Sasuke sought his own<br> way to bring peace to the world, making him one<br> of the most complex characters in the series.</p>

                <h2 class="madara">Madara Uchiha</h2>
                <p>Madara was one of the founders of the Hidden Leaf<br> Village and once dreamed of a world without war.<br> But his ideals twisted over time, leading him to<br> believe that true peace could only come through<br> illusion and control. Betrayed by his own clan and<br> rival, Hashirama Senju, Madara chose to manipulate<br> destiny itself through the Infinite Tsukuyomi — a<br> plan to trap humanity in an eternal dream. His power<br> and conviction made him a near-godlike figure, both<br> feared and respected as one of history’s most legendary<br> shinobi.</p>
